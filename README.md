This Ansible role is designed to configure **Ubuntu 22.04** to **comply** with the **CIS Ubuntu Linux Benchmark v2.0.0**. \
It automates the application of hardening recommendations to enhance system security. \
While this role can help mitigate common security risks, it is essential to tailor the configurations to your specific environment.

Based on **[CIS Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0](https://downloads.cisecurity.org/#/)**.

Tested with:

- Ubuntu 22.04
- Ubuntu 23.04

## Disclaimer

> [!DANGER]
>
> This role makes **significant changes to your system** that **could break functionality**. \
> This is not an auditing tool but rather a remediation tool to be used after an audit has been conducted. \
> While based on industry-standard security guidelines (CIS), it is recommended to review these changes, especially when applied to existing systems.

This role was **developed against a clean install** of the Operating System. \
If you are **implementing to an existing system** please **review thoroughly** this role for any **site specific changes** before applying them to production systems.

Strongly advise testing in a staging environment before applying in production.

## Notes

- section :: 6.2.1.2 **Configure systemd-journal-remote**
  - is configured, but not in deep tested _(default not setup with remote logging)_
- section :: 4.2 **Configure nftables**
  - is configured, but not in deep tested _(default ufw is used from section 4.1)_
- section :: 4.3 **Configure iptables**
  - is configured, but not in deep tested _(default ufw is used from section 4.1)_
- section :: 5.3 **Pluggable Authentication Modules** :: 5.4 **User Accounts and Environment**
  - could be tested deeper, base tests are performed and for secure only used for fresh os install

## Requirements

Before using this role, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- Python >= 3.12
- Ansible >= 2.16
- SSH access to the target machine.

Install required tools and libraries:

```sh
$sudo apt install python3 python3-pip sshpass
$python3 -m pip install ansible ansible-lint yamllint --break-system-packages
```

For run **tests** with **molecule**, you need also to **install**:

```sh
$python3 -m pip install molecule molecule-plugins[docker] --break-system-packages
```

## Role Variables

### Run only setup per section

> _Default all section are active and will performed_

```yaml

### Variables not included in CIS as additional extend

```yaml
# Extend the default sshd_config hardening to remove unnecessary comments and empty lines.
# 'true' by default.
cis_ubuntu2204_rule_5_1_0: true

# Extend the default sshd_config hardening, which not defined within CIS,
# by include more configuration based on https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/openssh.html.
# 'true' by default, but only runs if
#  - 'cis_ubuntu2204_rule_5_1_24_ssh_pub_key' is defined or
#  - 'cis_ubuntu2204_ssh_password_authentication' is equals 'yes'
cis_ubuntu2204_rule_5_1_23: true

# Avoid SSH login lockout by specifying the user and public key for SSH access.
# Lockout will happen when 'cis_ubuntu2204_rule_5_1_19', 'cis_ubuntu2204_rule_5_1_20' and 'cis_ubuntu2204_rule_5_1_23' are used.
# Ensure that a valid SSH public key is provided, or set this rule to false.

## Definitions

### Profile

A collection of recommendations for securing a technology or a supporting platform.
Most benchmarks include at least a **Level 1** and **Level 2** Profile.
**Level 2** extends **Level 1** recommendations and is not a standalone profile.
The Profile Definitions section in the benchmark provides the definitions
as they pertain to the recommendations included for the technology.

For **Level 1** and **Level 2** and the split into **Server** and **Workstation**,
are defined by **tags** in the tasks by:

- server_l1
- server_l2
- workstation_l1
- workstation_l2

For more specific description see the **CIS pdf** file on **page 18**.
