Configure Ubuntu 22.04 to be CIS compliant.

Tested with:

- Ubuntu 22.04
- Ubuntu 23.04

This role **will make changes to the system** that could break things. \
This is not an auditing tool but rather a remediation tool to be used after an audit has been conducted.

This role was **developed against a clean install** of the Operating System. \
If you are **implementing to an existing system** please **review** this role for any **site specific changes** that are needed.

Based on **[CIS Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.0](https://downloads.cisecurity.org/#/)**.

## Notes

- section :: 6.2.1.2 **Configure systemd-journal-remote**
  - is configured, but not in deep tested _(default not setup with remote logging)_
- section :: 4.2 **Configure nftables**
  - is configured, but not in deep tested _(default ufw is used from section 4.1)_
- section :: 4.3 **Configure iptables**
  - is configured, but not in deep tested _(default ufw is used from section 4.1)_
- section :: 5.3 **Pluggable Authentication Modules** :: 5.4 **User Accounts and Environment**
  - could be tested deeper, base tests are performed and for secure only used for fresh os install

## Requirements

You should **carefully read** through the tasks
to **make sure these changes will not break your systems**
before running this playbook.

To start working in this Role you just need to **install** **Python** and **Ansible**:

```sh
$sudo apt install python3 python3-pip sshpass
# if python >= 3.11 used, add also '--break-system-packages'
$python3 -m pip install ansible ansible-lint yamllint
```

For run **tests** with **molecule**, you need also to **install**:

```sh
# if python >= 3.11 used, add also '--break-system-packages'
$python3 -m pip install molecule molecule-plugins[docker]
```

## Role Variables

### run only setup per section

> _default all section are active and will performed_

## Definitions

### Profile

A collection of recommendations for securing a technology or a supporting platform.
Most benchmarks include at least a **Level 1** and **Level 2** Profile.
**Level 2** extends **Level 1** recommendations and is not a standalone profile.
The Profile Definitions section in the benchmark provides the definitions
as they pertain to the recommendations included for the technology.

For **Level 1** and **Level 2** and the split into **Server** and **Workstation**,
are defined by **tags** in the tasks by:

- server_l1
- server_l2
- workstation_l1
- workstation_l2

For more specific description see the **CIS pdf** file on **page 18**.
